# This script attempts to process a file, but it has a subtle bug related to how it handles file input.

# It reads the file line by line.  The problem arises when a line contains whitespace characters,
# specifically spaces and tabs, at the beginning or end of the line.

# The script's goal is to print only the non-whitespace content of each line.

while IFS= read -r line; do
  # This line attempts to remove leading and trailing whitespace.
  trimmed_line="$(echo "$line" | xargs)"
  echo "$trimmed_line"
done < "input.txt"

# Input file: input.txt
# Example contents of input.txt
#  leading space
#trailing space 
# multiple spaces  
# tabs

# The bug causes unexpected output or behavior, specifically failing to remove whitespace correctly and potentially cutting off some lines depending on line content.
